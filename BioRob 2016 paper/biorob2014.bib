abstract = {PURPOSE: The movements at each thumb joint are flexion and extension (called radial abduction in the CMCJ) and additional movements of anteposition, retroposition and opposition at the CMCJ, due to the saddle shape of the articulation. Our study was designed to provide a means of thumb movement measurement and provide a range for each. METHODS: A prospective cohort study was performed looking at 100 consecutive individuals without thumb pathology to determine thumb joint range of movements and evaluate the reliability of such measurements. RESULTS: The mean age was 26 (range of 18-37) with 62 female individuals. The mean range of movement of the IPJ was flexion of 88 ° (80-90 °) and extension of 12 ° (0-45 °). That of the MCPJ was flexion of 60 ° (43-70 °) and extension of 8.1 ° (0-15 °). That of the CMCJ was anteposition of 61.2 ° (50-71 °), retroposition of 31.1 mm (25-38 mm), radial abduction of 62.9 ° (53-71 °), opposition Kapandji grade 9 (grades 9-10) and adduction of 10.2 ± 4 ° (5-20 °). CMC adduction was difficult to measure with a poor intra- and inter-observer correlation (inter-reliability correlation coefficient of 0.02 and intra-reliability coefficient of 0.04). For the remaining measurements, the mean inter-reliability correlation coefficient was 0.82 (p < 0.01) while the mean intra-reliability correlation coefficient was 0.93 (p < 0.01). There was negative correlation identified between IPJ extension and MCPJ extension (-0.50) and between CMCJ radial abduction and MCPJ extension (-0.60). CONCLUSIONS: Having established the normal ranges of movements for the thumb joints and shown that our measurement methods are reliable and reproducible, we have identified that a reduction in certain thumb joint movements appears to be compensated for by an increased movement range in the other joints.},

abstract = {Precision manipulation, in which an object held between the fingertips is translated and/or rotated with respect to the hand without sliding, is used frequently in everyday tasks such as writing, yet few studies have examined the experimental precision manipulation workspace of the human hand. This study evaluates the range of positions over which 19 participants manipulated a moderately sized (3.3-4.1cm diameter) object using either the thumb and index finger (2 finger condition) or the thumb, index and middle fingers (3 finger condition). The results show that the 2-fingered workspace is on average 40 {\%} larger than the 3-fingered workspace (p <; 0.001, likely due to added kinematic constraints from an additional finger. Representative precision manipulation workspaces for a median 17.5cm length hand are shown from multiple views to clearly illustrate the overall workspace shape, while the general relationship between hand length and workspace volume is evaluated. This view of the human precision manipulation workspace has various applications, ranging from motivating the design of effective, comfortable haptic interfaces to benchmarking the performance of robotic and prosthetic hands.},

abstract = {The impressive manipulation capabilities of the human hand are undoubtedly related to the thumb opposition. Such a versatility is highly desirable in the context of humanoid robots, in particular when performing object manipulation. Biomechanical data, surgery procedures and rehabilitation surveys represent an excellent base from which a robotic design can be inferred. This knowledge must be understood to identify the properties required for manipulation skills, and especially, to obtain a holistic view of the thumb functionality. Several designs have been realized, that concentrated on biomimetism or on classical mechanism designs. Therefore, it is currently difficult for designers to obtain a clear overview of the properties required for a functional robot thumb. In the present case, a robotic hand with size, forces, velocity and shape comparable to the human ones, is envisioned. Unlike most of robotic designs-where the fingers are modular and the thumb is simply a finger placed in opposition-the thumb benefits from an intensive functional analysis. This paper gathers anatomy, surgery and rehabilitation data and identifies the properties required for human like manipulation. Based on this synergy, guidelines are presented that are fused and applied to the hand design of the Integrated Hand arm project of DLR.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Opposition is an important movement of the hand and rotation of the first metacarpal is the essential component. There is no agreement on the exact magnitude of rotation of the first metacarpal during opposition. This study used computed tomography to describe rotation measurement of the first metacarpal in the hands of a group of healthy individuals.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: The rotation of the first metacarpal was measured with reference to the fixed unit of the hand. Computed tomographic images were taken of the hands of 10 healthy individuals with the thumb in retroposition, resting position, and opposition to the index, middle, ring, and small fingers. On each image a tangential line was drawn along the dorsal margin of the second and third metacarpals. A second line was drawn through the head of the first metacarpal at the level of the sesamoids. The angle between the 2 lines was measured as the angle of rotation of the first metacarpal in different thumb positions.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The mean angle of rotation of the first metacarpal in retroposition was 54 degrees+/-10 degrees with reference to the fixed unit of the hand. In the resting position the angle of rotation of the first metacarpal changed to 74 degrees+/-10 degrees. In the position of opposition to the index, middle, ring, and small fingers the angle of rotation of the first metacarpal increased to 100 degrees+/-7 degrees , 103 degrees+/-6 degrees, 105 degrees+/-6 degrees, and 110 degrees+/-7 degrees, respectively.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The first metacarpal rotates 56 degrees when it moves from retroposition to the position of opposition to the small finger.},

abstract = {The axes of rotation of the thumb interphalangeal and metacarpophalangeal joints were located using a mechanical method. The interphalangeal joint axis is parallel to the flexion crease of the joint and is not perpendicular to the phalanx. This offset of the axis with respect to the phalanx explains the ulnar deviation and pronation that occurs with flexion of the interphalangeal joint. The metacarpophalangeal joint has 2 fixed axes: a fixed flexion-extension axis just distal and volar to the epicondyles, and an abduction-adduction axis related to the proximal phalanx passing between the sesamoids. Neither axis is perpendicular to the phalanges. All physiologic motion for these joints occurs about the axes. These are the mechanical axes of the joints through which the muscles and external forces act. Knowledge of their location should help in constructing prosthetic joints and in planning reconstructive surgery such as tendon transfers.},

abstract = {In this paper a comparative analysis between the human and three robotic hands is conducted. A series of metrics are introduced to quantify anthropomorphism and assess robot's ability to mimic the human hand. In order to quantify anthropomorphism we choose to compare human and robot hands in two different levels: comparing finger phalanges workspaces and comparing workspaces of the fingers base frames. The final score of anthropomorphism uses a set of weighting factors that can be adjusted according to the specifications of each study, providing always a normalized score between 0 (non-anthropomorphic) and 1 (human-identical). The proposed methodology can be used in order to grade the human-likeness of existing and new robotic hands, as well as to provide specifications for the design of the next generation of anthropomorphic hands. Those hands can be used for human robot interaction applications, humanoids or even prostheses.},

abstract = {A realistic biomechanical thumb model would elucidate the functional consequences of orthopedic and neurological diseases and their treatments. We investigated whether a single parametric kinematic model can represent all thumbs, or whether different kinematic model structures are needed to represent different thumbs. We used Monte Carlo simulations to convert the anatomical variability in the kinematic model parameters into distributions of Denavit-Hartenberg parameters amenable for robotics-based models. Upon convergence (3550 simulations, where mean and coefficient of variance changed < 1{\%} for the last 20 + {\%} simulations) the distributions of Denavit-Hartenberg parameters appeared multimodal, in contrast to the reported unimodal distributions of the anatomy-based parameters. Cluster analysis and one-way analysis of variance confirmed four types of kinematic models (p < 0.0001) differentiated primarily by the biomechanically relevant order of MCP joint axes (in 65.2{\%} of models, the flexion-extension axis was distal to the adduction-abduction axis); and secondarily by a detail specifying the direction of a common normal between successive axes of rotation. Importantly, this stochastic analysis of anatomical variability redefines the debate on whether a single generic biomechanical model can represent the entire population, or if subject-specific models are necessary. We suggest a practical third alternative: that anatomical and functional variability can be captured by a finite set of model-types.},
