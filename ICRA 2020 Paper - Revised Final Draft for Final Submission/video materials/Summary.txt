This video explores the conceptualization of a human-like thumb for use in a robotic hand, where the thumb's design is not only a function of a simplified kinematic model based on that of the human thumb, but also on empirical trials of surgical techniques to retain functionality while reducing the number of joints in the thumb. The motion of our biomimetic thumb’s carpometacarpal joint takes advantage of a known relationship between two similar prolate ellipses, in that they are constrained to roll without slipping when a linkage is established between their opposite foci, by expanding this into a relationship between ellipsoids for use in a carpometacarpal joint. To prevent subluxation of the joint, four c-type flexure hinges are milled from polypropylene, and are fixed to milled brass torches which encage the prolate ends of two similar magnetic ceramic ellipsoids, whose fields are oriented normal to the minor ellipsoidal axes to constrain the joint about its second degree of freedom. A motion tracking system is used to measure the excursion of points on the thumb’s surface, while tendon displacement is measured via linear encoders, and the smoothness of this data is quantified using a proposed metric of the normalized relative velocity of the tendon and end effector space vectors. The smoothness of this metric when applied to our data suggests visually that our device is capable of fine manipulation tasks at any point in its workspace, and finally its workspace is shown relative to that of the TU Hand, which will enable future work towards dexterous manipulation utilizing this device.
